# French Embassy Hackathon Series

This repo hosts the content for the [French Embassy Hackathon Series: Ed Hack 2017 site](http://www.frenchedhack.com/). 

The French Embassy Hackathon Series is a French Embassy in the US initiative in partnership with Zach Thomas and myself to encourage Franco-US integration, particularly in education. The series consists of two hackathons. The first event focuses on student mobility, and the second emphasizes improving US schools through French immersion programs.

Developers, data scientists, and UX designers of all ages and experience levels are encouraged to attend one or both events. All participants will be invited to attend a celebratory reception taking place at the French Embassy.

# Bootstrap

This site is _probably_ the closest one could come to making a website with as few of edits to a Bootstrap template as possible. The site is a near clone of Bootstrap's [Landing Page Theme](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/landing-page/).

Credits and thanks to the creators of the template [Mark Otto](https://twitter.com/mdo) and [Jacob Thorton](https://twitter.com/fat). Thanks to [David Miller](http://davidmiller.io/) of [Blackrock Digital](http://blackrockdigital.io/) for maintaining [Start Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).
